                        I am a PhD candidate in philosophy and a Core Curriculum Preceptor at Columbia University.

                    <p>
                        My research lies at the intersection of philosophy of race, social philosophy, and the social sciences.

                        My current project draws on these fields to develop an interdisciplinary framework for explaining the resilience of social structures of racial oppression. I am especially interested in explaining what leads agents who self-identify as non-racist to lend their support (active or passive) to practices, policies and institutions that reinforce racial inequality.

                    <h3>Structural Racism and the Explanation of Racial Inequality</h3>
                    <h4>Dissertation Abstract</h4>
                    <p>My dissertation argues that the concept of structural racism is vital 
                        to anti-racist theory and practice because it helps us explain the durability of racial inequality. 
                        To develop this explanatory claim, I elaborate an account of structural racism in terms of racially oppressive social structures. 
                        A defining feature of oppressive social structures—racial and otherwise—is that they systematically 
                        disadvantage a social group, while simultaneously benefitting another. Structural racism explains durable racial inequality insofar as it 
                        motivates agents who benefit from relations of race-based advantage/disadvantage to act in ways that preserve those advantages. 
                        This motivational effect of structural racism ensures the support (active of passive) of enough advantaged agents to maintain racial inequality. 
                        My dissertation develops this explanatory claim with reference to a recent sociological case study of a U.S. high school in 
                        which white parents support social practices that reinforce racial disparities in students' educational attainment. 
                        As the case study makes clear, white parents' support for these social practices is rooted in their desire to preserve the 
                        competitive advantages that their children derive from them.

                    <h3>On the Connection Between Institutional Racism and Racist Ideology</h3>
                    <h4>Paper under review</h4>
                    <p>
                        The claim that racism can be predicated of institutions challenges the 
                        mainstream view that racism is a matter of individuals’ beliefs, volitions and dispositions. 
                        However, this claim is essential to an adequate understanding of the persistence of unjust 
                        racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. Tommie Shelby has developed a philosophical 
                        account of institutional racism, which despite holding promise, requires revision in order 
                        to properly articulate what makes certain institutions racist. In particular, Shelby must 
                        rethink the connection between racist ideology and a certain type of racist institutions 
                        in order not to end up with an over-inclusive account of institutional racism (as it currently 
                        stands, Shelby’s account would count affirmative-action institutions as racist). 
                        In criticizing this aspect of Shelby’s account, I propose that we conceive of racist ideology
                        —which in the present context takes the form of colorblind ideology—as accommodating institutions 
                        that reproduce unjust racial disadvantage. In other words, what makes such institutions racist 
                        is not the work they do for racist ideology (as Shelby argues), but the work that racist ideology does for them.

                    <h3>The Role of Motivation in Structural Explanations of Oppression</h3>
                    <h4>Paper in the works</h4>
                    <p>
                        This paper undertakes a critical engagement with the literature on structural explanations of 
                        durable oppression (Cudd 2006, Haslanger 2016). On the standard story, structural constraints on 
                        agency explain why members of oppressed groups sometimes contribute to their own oppression, which
                        in turn explains the durability of oppression. While sympathetic to the standard story, this paper
                        offers a complementary explanation of durable oppression that focuses not on the victims of oppression,
                        but on its beneficiaries. In particular, my explanation seeks to make sense of why well-meaning members
                        of privileged groups often act (or fail to act) so as to maintain oppression. In addition, my account 
                        provides a more complete picture of the role that social structures play in the reproduction of 
                        oppression. Whereas the standard story focuses on the constraining power of social structures, 
                        my account also considers the motivating power of social structures on the agency of individuals. 
                        More specifically, I introduce the concept of positional interests (viz. interests that attaches 
                        to individuals qua occupiers of a position in a social structure) as crucial for understanding 
                        how social structures motivate those who benefit from an oppressive social structure to act (or fail to act) 
                        so as to sustain such structures. In other words, positional interests explain the tendency for oppression
                        -maintaining action among privileged agents, and in so doing, explain the durability of oppression.

                    <h3>Institutional Racism and the Conceptual Inflation Challenge</h3>
                    <h4>Paper in the works</h4>
                    <p>
                        I address the challenge that the concept of institutional racism inflates the term 'racism' without proper analytical rigor. 
                        Conceptual inflation critics argue that the concept of institutional racism undermines our assessment of race-
                        related wrongs, gets in the way of cross-racial dialogue, and weakens the explanatory power of the concept of 
                        racism. In response, I show that my account of institutional racism actually improves our understanding of 
                        race-related wrongs and contributes to the explanation of durable racial inequality. Moreover, the aim of 
                        having a concept of institutional racism is not to facilitate cross-racial dialogue, but rather to articulate the 
                        mechanisms behind the reproduction of racial inequality.

                    <h3>Is Culturally-Induced Moral Ignorance Blameless?</h3>
                    <h4>Paper in the works</h4>
                    <p>
                        I argue against the widespread claim that an agent's culture may limit their access to morally relevant 
                        facts to the point of exculpating them for partaking in unjust social practices. I do so by challenging 
                        four reasons commonly used by defenders of this view: anti-moralism, the 'ought implies can' maxim, the 
                        control principle, and the assumption of moral ignorance as an honest mistake.

                <h3>Teaching statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The guiding aim of my teaching is to make philosophy resonate with my students. I introduce philosophy as a set 
                    of conceptual and methodological tools that students can use to shed light on previously muddled or 
                    taken-for-granted aspects of their lives. In my experience, once I get students to find how philosophy is relevant 
                    to their lives, it becomes easier to guide them through the class assignments and activities that will help them 
                    sharpen their critical thinking skills and reflect on the class material. My second goal is to give students the 
                    means to acquire agency over their learning. To this end, I rely on student feedback over the course of the term 
                    to adapt class assignments to my students' varying interests and styles of learning. I also design class assignments 
                    that incorporate elements of self-and-peer assessment. Finally, I like to bring the interdisciplinary approach of my 
                    research into the classroom. I often introduce relevant materials from other disciplines and encourage my students 
                    to do the same.
